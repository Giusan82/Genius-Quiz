Here there is an app that I made for the third project "Quiz App" of the course "Android for Beginners".

So I decide of building up an app quizzes on topics about chemistry.

Here some screenshot:

</p>

I added free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons. The result is shown a toast popup message and as text at the bottom. An scrollview was added due to the high number of questions. A custom icon on actions bar and laucher.

I hope you like this app and you will find it useful.

Please give me your feedback for any improvement or any issue or if have question I will happy to help you.
